<h1>Lab 3: File Sructure and File Transfer</h1>
<div class="test">

	<h2>Subject</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this lab is to creat local files and practice creating html files.
	As well as to share flies with current working classmate as a refresher. </p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One main challange was trying to practice again wiht the CSS code mainly because css is tricky to me. </p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
  <p>This assignment was reletively easy, mainly because I already had to to
		this last semester setting up files. By making a new folder, and in it
		making other folders for the CSS, Images, and Index files.</p>

<p>This was made in collabration with Everett Lomath</p>
