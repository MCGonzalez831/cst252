 <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>


 <h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Challanges that I had with this is lab were not being able to figure out how to inplement this lab at first.
I eventually figured what was the problem by going over the sript and following it closely.</p>

 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p>I wasn't sure how the JS would work and then I realized that something was wrong in my code for it not to work.
So I painstakingly had to combe each line of code to see what it was. Turns out, I had misspelled somethings (like I am already doing in this)
But that was the only problem I had this lab. Besdies still not </p>

 <h2>Resutls</h2>
<p>I got a cool new feature! I am also very tired right now</p>
