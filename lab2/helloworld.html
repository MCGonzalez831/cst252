		   I aspire to be a storyboard artist and professional graphic designer working
		   for the graphic department of companies.</p>

		<p>Besides being a student, I am also a freelance Illustator who does comission work on the side.</p>

    <p>I am still learing how to code and while this page is definelty an imporvement compared to last semesters, I am still learing. </p>

<p>I hope to slowly imporvemore with this class and add more cool features
	 like the ones I found for lab 1. Mainly just want to know how to add small
	  noticable features that won't make my website look so bland haha.
	Like this for example, I still have a hard time trying to align the picture on the HTML and make the text wrap around it!</p>
