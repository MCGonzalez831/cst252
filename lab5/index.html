<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>

<img src="img/list.PNG" alt="img">

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>trying to get the js to show up, realizing the name on the lab js was wrong,
	changing the css, and finding the motivation to finish the lab. Also tyring to
	fix the image to be contained, kinda just gave up on that one. </p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>Trying to get the JS to work, even tho I've copied it word for word and its
not working. Like it's not showing up how wes has it on his page unless I sitll
have to do Pesudocoding? Nevermind I found the problem after spending 10 mintues cross refrencing this lab with the js. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I finally got it to work because I noticed the age of the car example. So, overall,
this lab was confusing mainly because I realized that my js link code was wrong. It was "js/lab5.js" NOT "js/lab.js" </p>
