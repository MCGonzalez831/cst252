	<h1>Lab 4: Pesudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
<img src="img/inst.PNG" alt="simple">

<h2>Subject</h2>

<p>According to Wes, this is what the lab is supposed to be?</p>


<p>"With your partner, pseudocode an everyday task most students may not be
	 familiar with. Examples include, changing a tire, making salsa, baking bread,
	 getting an A in a class, or making art.Create a list of high-level tasks.
	  If necessary, break complicated tasks down into sub-steps.Put this in outline form".</p>




<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>I was very confused by the lab but I did manage to work through it thanks to help of Everett. He does not get paid to help me and he honestly should lol.
It was mainly an issuse of the instructions being somewhat confusing.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
I know how to do Javascrpit a little bit! Still don't know a lot but I kinda know how it looks like in practice.
