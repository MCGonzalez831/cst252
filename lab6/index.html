<h2>Challanges</h2>

 <p>Trying to finish the lab in a reasonable arount of time. My usual partner for the lab got
 COVID, so I was alone for this lab. But frear not, Alex Woody saved the day.</p>


<h2>problems</h2>
<p>The main problem that I had with this lab was that I couldn't get the consel part
to work. As in all my imputs, that were put in word for word, did not work. Because that took so
much time and effort I realized that I could just do the rest of the lab. Still don't know why that didn't work.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I kinda code better with JavaScript. Still frusturating but mainly becasue of the consel thing. </p>
